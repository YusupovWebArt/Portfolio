  fullDescription:
    'Using Elementor and custom HTML/CSS/JS/PHP code, I created a unique design based on an old client theme (the client asked to keep the old theme). Also used was a tool such as ACF (Advanced Custom Fields). For page https://alldaymedicalcare.com/doctors/, a unique template was created based on PHP with the functions of filtering doctors according to the established parameters.',

  features: [
    <p>
      <strong>Custom WordPress Theme Development:</strong> Built from scratch to
      meet specific business needs, ensuring complete control over design and
      functionality.
    </p>,
    <p>
      <strong>Advanced Custom Fields &#40;ACF&#41;:</strong> Utilized for
      flexible content management, allowing clients to easily update and manage
      their website&#39;s content without technical expertise.
    </p>,
    <p>
      <strong>Custom CSS3/JS & PHP: </strong> Designed for unique styling and
      dynamic functionality, ensuring a highly personalized user experience and
      smooth performance.
    </p>,
    <p>
      <strong>Elementor Page Builder: </strong> To deliver a unique and refined
      user experience within a short timeframe, I enhanced the Elementor-based
      development with custom CSS3 and JavaScript. This allowed for advanced
      animations, interactive elements, and precise styling that went beyond the
      default capabilities of the page builder. The combination ensured both
      creative flexibility and optimized performance across all devices. The use
      of a page builder was a client requirement, as they wanted the ability to
      independently edit content and layout elements in the future.
    </p>,
    <p>
      <strong>Responsive Design: </strong> Optimized for all devices, ensuring
      seamless navigation and user experience across desktops, tablets, and
      smartphones.
    </p>,
    <p>
      <strong>SEO Optimization: </strong> Built with best SEO practices in mind,
      including fast load times, clean code, and structure that boosts search
      engine visibility.
    </p>,
    <p>
      <strong>Customizable User Interface: </strong> Provides an easily editable
      backend for ongoing site updates, empowering the client to make changes
      without developer intervention.
