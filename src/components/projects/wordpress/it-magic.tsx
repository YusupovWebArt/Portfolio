    'The IT-Magic project represents a comprehensive, end-to-end AWS and DevOps solution provider — from infrastructure design and migration to ongoing support and optimization.',
  fullDescription:
    'I developed the corporate website itmagic.pro, which presents the company’s AWS, DevOps, infrastructure management, and cloud consulting services. The main goal of the project was to build a fast, modern, and conversion-oriented website that strengthens the company’s brand and effectively communicates its technical expertise. For several years, I have been the sole developer responsible for ongoing website improvements, feature updates, landing page creation, and technical maintenance. Worked closely with the SEO team, implementing structural changes, technical SEO improvements, schema, and optimized page layouts to increase rankings and conversions.',
