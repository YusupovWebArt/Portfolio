  features: [
    <p>
      <strong>Custom WordPress Theme Development:</strong> Built from scratch to
      meet specific business needs, ensuring complete control over design and
      functionality.
    </p>,
    <p>
      <strong>WooCommerce Integration:</strong> Seamlessly integrated with
      WooCommerce to provide robust eCommerce functionality, including product
      management, secure checkout, and payment gateway support.
    </p>,
    <p>
      <strong>Elementor Page Builder: </strong> To deliver a unique and refined
      user experience within a short timeframe, I enhanced the Elementor-based
      development with custom CSS3 and JavaScript. This allowed for advanced
      animations, interactive elements, and precise styling that went beyond the
      default capabilities of the page builder. The combination ensured both
      creative flexibility and optimized performance across all devices. The use
      of a page builder was a client requirement, as they wanted the ability to
      independently edit content and layout elements in the future.
    </p>,
    <p>
      <strong>Custom CSS3/JS & PHP: </strong> Designed for unique styling and
      dynamic functionality, ensuring a highly personalized user experience and
      smooth performance.
    </p>,
    <p>
      <strong>Responsive Design: </strong> Optimized for all devices, ensuring
      seamless navigation and user experience across desktops, tablets, and
      smartphones.
    </p>,
    <p>
      <strong>SEO Optimization: </strong> Built with best SEO practices in mind,
      including fast load times, clean code, and structure that boosts search
      engine visibility.
